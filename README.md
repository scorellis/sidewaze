# sidewaze
Script collection for collapsing multiple file archives into one.  For example, you have ten hard drives lying around, so you copy all of the My Documents and Desktop folders into a series of folders on a drive.  Run this package, and it will intelligently collapse everything to one folder structure on another drive.
